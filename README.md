## Indices on the Body
This project grew in dialogue with another ongoing project titled 58+1 Indices on the body. That project is a collaboration between the artistic collective AMAE and the artist Pier Giorgio De Pinto. The topics come from the treaty 58 indices sur le corps (Editorâ€™s note 58 indices on the body), written in 2006 by Jean-Luc Nancy and related to his book Corpus. The project combines performances, videos, interactive installations and collaborations with many artists.

As part of this project Jean Luc Nancy recorded himself reading the 58 indices on the body he included in the book 'Corpus', he also wrote an additional index specifically for the project. 
The project presented here grew out of a collaboration with AMAE, Pier Giorgio De Pinto and Jean Luc Nancy in which the artist applying here originally set some of these indices to music in 2015. The result was a piece that the collaborators were invited to present during the Helicotrema festival at the Francois Pinault Foundation in Venice alongside La Biennale events taking place throughout the city.

Later the artist recorded additional Soundworks and musical pieces incorporating Nancy's indexes, a portion of which will be set to dance as part of the 63 Videos on the Body project.

The current piece collects all of the artists sonic/musical work for the project to date. These works are presented in the form of a web app. The audience is invited to listen to the pieces, and reflect on the indices which have been translated into English from Nancy's native French by Richard A. Rand for the Perspectives in Continental Philosophy Series.  

The piece can be made available for the audience listening online using the web app, and it can also be installed and set to play automatically in place over a pair of stereo speakers, although this is obviously not a site-specific piece.  

In the interests of anonymity, the name of the artist has not been provided.
